Trike  
-----

As a recumbent trike rider, and a frequent traveller on the GB canal system, I would like to have maps on my navigation devices that assist. I have **NCN 1** fairly near me, and fond memories of riding it when I rode a 2 wheel bike and was a Sustrans Ranger, but parts of it are a 'show stopper' for me on my trike as they have narrow gaps between bollards which require me to get off and try to lift the trike over a chest high gate - not easy or fun for me if on my own - I'm thinking that some kind of warning on the map so I can chose whether to try to negotiate the barrier, or not go that way at all, would be helpful.  


Wheelchair & 'electric buggy'  
----------

There are similarities between my needs on a recumbent trike, and the needs of a wheelchair user - width, and smoothness of terrain are important considerations. Maybe something that works for a trike can be slightly adapted for a wheelchair user. I have friends who have mentioned how frustrating it is to go somewhere with a walk planned, only to find they can't get the wheelchair out of the car park!  


Home Computers  
--------------

Sometimes I have no internet access when planning, and I've found that [QMapShack](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/DocMain) is very good. It works with Garmin Maps, and can be entirely offline. It runs well on my Ubuntu laptop, and also on my frequently used RPI4 running Raspbian. I often research my rides, or OSM survey rides, before I go. My wife and I have a long term project of riding the complete [North Sea Cycle Ride](https://en.eurovelo.com/ev12/united-kingdom) and an offline programme I can use in my caravan without internet access comes in very handy. 


Canal or Waterways
------------------

Holidaying on a canal boat in the UK is another passion. My mobile phone with [OSMAND+]{https://osmand.net/) works extremely well, but the phone battery does not last for long when navigating. Using a handheld or cycle GPS works well, but I need a dedicated map which shows **bridge_ref** and **Lock names** other relevant canal features - it will never replace the printed Canal Guides, but something that shows me where I am so I know which page to look for in the guide would be handy.  


Guides and Resources
