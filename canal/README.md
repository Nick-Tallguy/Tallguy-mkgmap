v1 - Have added details from Canal map - bridge refs, locks, and other bits including slightly different colour for canals.  
v2 - is now combined Canal, North Downs way, and Avenue Verte
v3 - also north sea cycle now - however some is missing. Also North Downs Way - parts where there are national cycle routes are also missing.
v4 - have moved sections up & down in the lines file so that the North Downs Way is above those ncn's, rcn's & lcn's that are not part of AV or NCS.  Have checked OSM - the EV12 relation has not been applied to the lower sections of ncn1, which is why they don't appear in my map. Various changes to make all relations and routes work.  
v5 - Showing all relations, but North Sea Cycle Route, Avenue Verte , but not North Downs Way, are showing the red ncn line inside the green broad band - makes it less distinctive.
v6 - lines file - have moved North Sea Cycle Route above the general ncn, rcn & lcn, and have removed the word 'continue' from the end of the lines definition for North Sea Cycle & Avenue Verte (it wasn't there for North Downs Way.  
v7 - enormous rework - now using shortcuts to inc files. Also producing windows exe file and gmapi for apple mac. typ files renamed to 5403.txt
